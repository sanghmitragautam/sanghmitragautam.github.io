              <p> This paper analyses the key barriers towards improved sanitation coverage at the household level in the developing world. The low levels of take-up of sanitation have been largely attributed to the large cost associated with the adoption of such a good. This statement is open to two interpretations. First, the act of building sanitation is a costly investment which necessitates a poor household that is liquidity constrained, to borrow funds to finance its adoption. Second, though the cost of adoption of sanitation is privately incurred, the returns realised to the household also depend on the actions of its fellow community members, indicating the presence of externalities. Both phenomenon justify the presence of public intervention to improve sanitation coverage. However, they both arise from two distinct sources of market failures, and as such require a different design of policy interventions. I formulate a life-cycle model of sanitation adoption and saving behaviour, incorporating both the presence of liquidity constraints as well as externalities which allows me to distinguish between these two channels. Using a unique dataset on adoption of sanitation from rural India, I address how existing policy interventions that aim to increase sanitation presence in the developing world may or may not meet their target. The estimates show that the presence of externalities is especially important in explaining household adoption behaviour. Simulations indicate that price subsidies and village level subsidies would stimulate adoption within a village at a much lower cost than provision of individual household loans. </p>

	    <p>In this paper, I study the impact of peer effects on the demand for a healthcare good and the subsequent welfare effects of a subsidy program towards its provision. Households face a choice of whether or not to adopt/buy a preventive healthcare good. An interesting characteristic, is that the take-up/consumption of such goods generate positive externalities. In this case, the outcome is such that the privately optimal adoption level is much lower than what the society as a whole would regard as optimal. </p>
	    <p>The application considers the adoption choice of Indian households with respect to a healthcare good. The data comes from the baseline survey of a RCT in India that provides microfinance credit and subsides to rural households for adoption of a sanitation facility for their home. The data is used to estimate a static interaction model of household choice. A pervasive feature of such models is the existence of multiple equilibria which makes the estimation process computationally burdensome. The estimation method is discussed, which includes a two-step estimator with a correction for the presence of measurement error in the data, in the first step.</p>
            <p>In addition to counterfactual policy simulations, the focus lies in quantifying the compensated choice probability and corresponding price elasticities. For a random utility model, the slutsky equation per se does not exist and hence the compensated choice probability is derived through the random expenditure function. In the presence of social interactions, the compensated price effect comprises of a direct effect of price as well as an indirect effect propagated through the interactions. Using the analytical expressions for compensated choice probability price subsidy simulations are undertaken. The results indicate that a significant amount of the price effect is mediated through the indirect channel. Furthermore, the compensated choice probability function is used to calculate welfare measures such as compensating and equivalent variation. The inclusion of peer effect implies that the deadweight loss generated by the subsidy intervention is realised as a net gain, as the society shifts towards a socially optimal level of adoption.</p>

	    <p> This paper develops a correction method for existing Two-step methods to estimate static discrete choice models of incomplete information. Under the assumption that only one equilibrium is played in the data, two-step estimators avoid the computational burden associated with repeatedly solving the fixed point for each candidate vector of structural parameters. However, the estimator relies on obtaining consistent choice probability estimates in first step, given that observed data is generated from one of possible equilibria. The problem can be treated as one of contamination of the variable of interest by measurement error. Using insights from small variance approximation to probability distributions, I adapt the error correction method proposed by Chesher (1991) to the estimation of simple static interaction models. The method is applied to estimate Brock & Durlauf's (2001) interaction model which has been the cornerstone in the study of peer effects in recent literature. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to approximate the magnitude of the impact of error in data and the resulting bias in parameter estimates.</p>
